<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
<p>Twas bryllyg, and ye slythy toves<br>
    Did gyre and gymble in ye wabe:<br>
    All mimsy were ye borogoves;<br>
    And ye mome raths outgrabe.<br></p>
<p>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
    The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br></p>
<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
    Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br>
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
    And stood awhile in thought.<br></p>
<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
    And burbled as it came!<br></p>
<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
    He left it dead, and with its head<br>
    He went galumphing back.<br></p>
<p>"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br>
    He chortled in his joy.<br></p>
<p>`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
    And the mome raths outgrabe.<br></p>
